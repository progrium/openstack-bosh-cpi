## Example

This is a sample of how OpenStack specific properties are used in a BOSH deployment manifest:

    ---
    name: sample
    director_uuid: 38ce80c3-e9e9-4aac-ba61-97c676631b91

    ...

    networks:
      - name: nginx_network
        type: vip
        cloud_properties: {}
      - name: default
        type: dynamic
        cloud_properties:
          security_groups:
          - default

    ...

    resource_pools:
      - name: common
        network: default
        size: 3
        stemcell:
          name: bosh-stemcell
          version: 0.6.7
        cloud_properties:
          instance_type: m1.small

    ...

    properties:
      openstack:
        auth_url: http://pistoncloud.com/:5000/v2.0/tokens
        username: christopher
        api_key: QRoqsenPsNGX6
        tenant: Bosh
        region: us-west
        default_key_name: bosh
        default_security_groups: ["bosh"]
        private_key: /home/bosh/.ssh/bosh.pem
